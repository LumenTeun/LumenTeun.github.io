For me, coding isn't simply about software though; coding is just a symptom of my fascination with everything and an almost innate desire to tinker and help out with stuff. Naturally, I've been a huge fan of open source software since I first came into contact with (and comprehended) the concept. If you're curious, you can check out what I've done on my GitHub and GitLab accounts." ]

Contrary to popular belief, they are not simply drugs of abuse - although they certainly can be misused - but, used with the right set and setting, they can - and did with me - help people with mental health issues such as depression, let terminal people confront and come to terms with death, or build trust and strengthen bonds within yourself and between you and friends. If reading this made you either highly uncomfortable or dimiss me as a junkie, I highly recommend you try to ignore that feeling for just a couple of minutes and either watch this TEDx by Imperial College London researcher Robin Carhart-Harris or read the excellent article 'The Trip Treatment' by Michael Pollan. Also feel free to contact me if you have any questions." ]
